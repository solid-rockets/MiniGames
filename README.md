Welcome to the MiniGames project. I have started it as a general repository for
making simple browser games, mostly to exercise my programming skills.

The purpose of the following README is (1) to introduce the contents of the
repository to the reader and (2) to list the rules I shall follow when working
on these projects.

-----

All games:

- Nothing yet!

-----

Rules for all games:
1) Must run in the browser out of the box.
2) Must be written in either
  a) JavaScript.
  b) a language that can be easily transpiled into JS/Wasm: TypeScript, etc.
3) Must be within 10,000 LOCs. Games larger than that shall be broken out.

Other rules:
1) All git commits shall follow the Semantic Commit Messages convention.
2) The following GitHub functionality shall be used:
  a) Copilot.
  b) Project management tools (Issues, etc).
3) External changes shall not be accepted, but please feel free to clone.
