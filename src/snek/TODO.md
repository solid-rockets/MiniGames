DONE

- Setup + load assets.
- Draw the board.
- Draw the snake.
- Wall collision.
- Input.
- Egg eating.
- Self collision.
- Scale everything.
- For better input detection: inc FPS but slow down snake.
    - One way to do it is to make FPS 30 but move snake every X frames.

TODO
- Alternative blocks for orientations:
    - Body
    - Turn
- Randomized positions
- Change order of movement: move, check, place body immediately.
- Text: "Game over! Try again? Y/N"
- Get rid of all TODOs in code.
